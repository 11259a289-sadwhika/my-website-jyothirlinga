<p>Mallikarjuna Swamy Temple or Srisailam Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to the deities Shiva and Parvati, located at Srisailam in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It is significant to the Hindu sects of both Shaivism and Shaktism as this temple is referred to as one of the twelve Jyotirlingas of Shiva and as one of the fifty two Shakta pithas, centres of the Hindu goddess.[1] Shiva is worshiped as Mallikarjuna and is represented by the lingam. His consort Parvati is depicted as Bhramaramba.</P>
<ul>
<li>Mallikarjuna Jyotirlinga is special in that it is both a jyotirlinga and a Shakti Peetha (special shrine to Shakti Devi – there are 18 of them) – there are only three such temples in India.
<li>It is believed that Lord Shiva appeared as Arjuna on Amavasya (No moon day) and Goddess Parvati as Mallika on Poornima (full moon day), and hence the name Mallikarjuna.
<li>The temple is a work of architecture with its tall towers and beautiful carvings. It is also enclosed within tall walls that fortify it.
<li>Devotees believe that visiting this temple brings them wealth and fame.
<li>It is believed that Goddess Parvati fought the demon Mahishasura by transforming herself into a bee. Devotees believe they can still hear a bee buzzing through a hole in the Bhramaramba temple!
<li>While this temple hosts visitors throughout the year, it would be best to visit it in the winter months i.e. October to February. Visiting it during Mahashivratri (on 8th March this year) would be the ultimate treat for any devotee!
<h1>Story behind the Mallikarjuna temple</h1>
<li>Lord Shiva and his consort Goddess Parvati could not make up their minds as to which of their sons, Ganesha or Kartikeya should get married first. To determine who would be first, they set a contest for the two: whoever would go around the world first would be the winner.

<li>Lord Kartikeya immediately set off on his mount, the peacock. Lord Ganesha, on the other hand, went around his parents claiming that they were the world to him. It is said that going around one’s parents is equivalent to going around the world. So, he outwitted his brother and won the race. The pleased parents married their son off to Siddhi (spiritual powers) and Riddhi (prosperity). In some legends, Buddhi (intellect) is also believed to be his wife.

<li>When Lord Kartikeya heard about this on his return, he was upset and decided that he would remain unmarried. (However, in some Tamil legends he is said to have two wives.) He left for Mount Krounch and started living there. His parents visited him there and hence there is a shrine for both there – a linga for Shiva and a Shakti Peetha for Parvati.
